          <p> <b> Dynamic fault trees:</b> While fault trees are easy to understand and thus, widely used, their modelling capabilities are severely limited. 
            This lack of flexibility hinders accurate and precise modelling of real-life systems. To overcome these drawbacks, several extensions of fault trees have been proposed in the last decades. 
            Dynamic fault trees (DFT) (Dugan et al., 1992) are a prominent extension of fault trees overcoming these limitations. DFTs have been co-developed by NASA to model more complex behaviours and dependability patterns.
             As such, DFTs can capture more realistic scenarios needed to handle the growing complexity in, e.g., self-driving cars, hyperloops and drones.</p>

          <p> <b> Dependability metrics: </b> While fault tree models represent how failures occur at system component level and how they propagate through sub-systems, eventually leading to system level failures,
             their analysis focuses on computing various dependability metrics, i.e. key performance indicators that measure how well a system performs. Standard metrics are the system:
            <br><u>Reliability</u> : the probability that no failure occurred until time T
             <br><u> Conditional Reliability</u> : the probability that no failure occurred until time T given a component has already failed
          <br> <u>Availability</u> : the average percentage of time that a system is operational
           <br> <u> Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) </u>: the mean time between failures, 
           <br><u> Criticality of components </u>: to what extent does a component failure contribute to a system failure, etc.

State space reduction techniques, such as symmetry reduction, bisimulation minimization (Baier and Katoen, 2008, Chap. 7),  reduce one model to a smaller one that is computationally equivalent. Approximative techniques allow one to approximate analysis results  upto arbitrary  precision.

            Several advanced methods (Ruijters et al., 2016; Ruijters et al., 2017, Volk et al., 2018) have been developed to analyze DFTs that apart from increasing the computational efficiency also provide more modeling power. Further, a wide variety of different metrics are offered, analyzing the system reliability under various scenarios. The combined power of these methods allows us to analyse DFTs that were out of scope before (Katoen and Stoelinga, 2017).

            The research results were published in highly ranked journals from both computer science and engineering.

We combine the best of both worlds by following Dugan’s approach: dynamic sub-trees are analysed via model checking Markov models and replaced by basic events capturing the obtained failure probabilities. The resulting SFT is then analysed via BDDs. Our implementation of Dugan’s approach significantly outperforms pure Markovian analysis of DFTs.</div>

       </p>
      <p>
        The need for rigorous risk assessments is rapidly increasing. On the one
        hand, international standards -- require rigorous and powerful fault
        tree analysis techniques. For instance, the recent ISO 26262 standard in
        autonomous driving asserts that “metrics are verifiable and precise
        enough to differentiate between different system architectures” and that
        “[for systems where the] concept is based on redundant safety
        mechanisms, multiple-point failures of a higher order than two are
        considered in the analysis” (ISO, 2011). Classical fault-tree analysis
        techniques cannot support the compliance of products to these
        requirements. Alternative, and more powerful means are needed that allow
        flexible modelling, a rich set of metrics, and powerful techniques for
        advanced analyses such as multiple-point failures of higher degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the rapidly increased usage of AI components in
        modern systems necessitates a rigorous risk assessment. Neural networks
        typically come with weak statistical guarantees only (if at all). Small
        perturbations of their inputs may lead to misclassifications that can be
        catastrophic in safety-critical applications: consider an AI component
        in an autonomous car that misclassifies a pedestrian who is crossing the
        street at an arbitrary place (and not at a cross-over). The use of AI
        components also implies the need for reliability metrics that go beyond
        the standard metrics of reliability and availability. In particular,
        there is a need to specify various levels of degradation (given the
        uncertainty of the AI components) and be able to analyse e.g., “what is
        the probability that the system will come to a halt without going
        through degradation level A first”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the increased constraints imposed by international standards
        together with the ever-growing penetration of AI components make
        rigorous and powerful risk assessment more important than ever.

        ESA, the Nuclear Research Group, Arcadis, Thales Alennia Space, Space
        Systems Finland, Ford, BMW and EDF have participated in academic
        projects to figure out the real potential of DFT. Together with these
        companies, the powerful modelling capabilities of DFT and the
        feasibility of our analysis approaches have been demonstrated in a range
        of industrial applications. Example applications include railway systems
        (Ruijters et al., 2016; Volk et al., 2019), smart buildings (Cauchi et
        al., 2017), autonomous driving (Ghadhab et al., 2019), aerospace systems
        (Esteve et al., 2012), and energy networks (Khan et al., 2019).

        These applications supported the involved companies in their decision
        making. For example, the cost analysis in (Ruijters et al., 2016) was
        used by ProRail when pursuing a new railroad joint, comparing the costs
        and reliability of various joint types. The experiences with the
        analysis of the HVAC helped the Dutch Railways (NS) to introduce fault
        tree analysis for various assets. The case study (Ghadhab et al, 2019)
        supported BMW in performing an extensive design space exploration,
        comparing several mappings from software onto different hardware
        architectures.
